# NetScan-Rust-
Netscan is a fast and efficient network scanning and web crawling tool built in Rust. It allows users to scan local networks to identify open IP addresses, subnets, and even specify custom IP ranges for more targeted results.

In addition to network scanning, Netscan includes a lightweight web crawler that explores reachable websites and extracts all accessible links.

Both the network scan results and crawled URLs are saved in easily readable .txt files, making it simple to access and utilize the data for further analysis or automation.

Key Features:

Scan local networks for active IPs

Support for scanning subnets and IP ranges

Built-in web crawler to gather all reachable URLs

Outputs saved to .txt files for convenience

Written in Rust for performance and reliability
